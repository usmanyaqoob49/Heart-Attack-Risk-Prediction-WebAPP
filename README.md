# Heart-Attack-Risk-Prediction-WebAPP
● Performed Data Ananlysis and Visualization on data to get insights:
 - Age and Heart Attack Risk
 - Gender and Heart Attack Risk
   
● After pre-processing the Data I trained different Machine Learning Algorithms:
 - Support Vector Classifier
 - Logistic Regression
 - Random Forest Classifier
 - Decision Tree Classifier.
   
● Made a Web App / Dashboard using Plotly Dash in which I included features like: 
 - User can see all the Visualization of the insights.
 - User can select the Machine Learning model and that specific model will be trained on the data and accuracy will be shown to user.
 - User can enter data of any person (features data) and selected model will do prediction on that and will return prediction to user.
